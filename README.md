## About The Project

h-matched Tracker measures and visualizes the acceleration of AI capabilities by tracking how quickly AI systems achieve human-level performance on various benchmarks. The project specifically monitors the duration between a benchmark's release and when it becomes "h-matched" (reached by AI at human-level performance).

### Key Features

- üìä Interactive visualization of AI benchmark completion trends
- üìà Detailed timeline of benchmark achievements
- üîç Comprehensive data on release dates, completion dates, and time-to-solve metrics

## Why This Matters

As AI systems continue to advance, the time between benchmark release and human-level achievement is shrinking. This tracker helps visualize this acceleration, providing insights into:

- The pace of AI capability development
- Areas where AI is rapidly approaching or surpassing human performance
- Trends in the difficulty of creating benchmarks that humans can reliably outperform
